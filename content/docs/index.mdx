# Armand Thuillart

I’m [designer and developer](/en/bio). I’m building [Norm](/en/norm), the best way to post with AI. I’ve been coding for 3 years and building for the second half.

My life’s work is to make people do more by doing less. I’m an entrepreneur, student, and a massive music fan. I last listened to [Retour](https://music.apple.com/fr/album/retour/1554300881?i=1554300882&l=en-GB) by Tony Anderson.

Some of my favorite essays include:

- [Beliefs](/en/beliefs)
- [AI](/en/ai)
- [Stack](/en/stack)

You can [read my writing](/en/writing) or [code](https://github.com/thuillart), follow me on [X](https://x.com/armandthuillart) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/armand-thuillart/). I also make [videos](https://www.youtube.com/@armand.thuillart), advise companies, and do angel investing. [Reach out](mailto:armand.thuillart@proton.me) if interested.
