# Armand Thuillart

I’m a [designer and developer](/bio). I'm building [Mosaïc](/mosaic), a social media management tool with AI. I’ve been coding for 5 years and building for the second half.

My life’s work is to make people's work less repetitive. I’m an entrepreneur, student, and a massive music fan. I last listened to [Ride on Time](https://soundcloud.com/user-421157951/ride-on-time-album-version) by Tatsuro Yamashita.

Some of my favorite essays include:

- [Things I Believe](/beliefs)
- [Products](/products)
- [Marketing](/marketing)

You can read my [writing](/writing) or [code](https://github.com/thuillart), follow me on [X](https://x.com/armandthuillart) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/armand-thuillart/).
