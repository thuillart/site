# Armand Thuillart

I’m a [designer and developer](/bio). I work on [Neap](/neap), the AI content creation studio. Previously, I studied at [UMB](https://www.umb.edu/). I’ve been coding for 3 years and building for the second half.

My life's work is making people’s lives easier. I’m an entrepreneur, student, and a massive music fan. I last listened to [Retour](https://music.apple.com/fr/album/retour/1554300881?i=1554300882&l=en-GB) by Tony Anderson.

Some of my favorite essays include:

- [Beliefs](/beliefs)
- [AI](/ai)
- [Stack](/stack)
