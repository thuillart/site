# Readings

<p className="text-muted-foreground">January 2026 - Armand Thuillart</p>

Instead of listing all the books I've read or listened to, here’s a few quotes from the ones that changed my life:

> *“It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed.”* — N. Hill

Most products are built on this principle. Take [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/), which helps you search your files faster, or [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/home), to help you code faster.

That’s why [Neap](/neap) exists, to help people post faster.

> *“The only way to be indispensable is to be different.”* — S. Godin

What marketing is about in 10 words. In every red ocean[^1], there’s a blue ocean[^2] waiting to be discovered.

[Neap](https://neap.app)'s competitors, direct or indirect, are taking the same path: a post scheduler for all users, for all platforms, for all types of content. 

To please everyone, you end up pleasing no one. 

> *“Question everything generally thought to be obvious.”* — D. Rams

It needs change when we think it doesn’t. Apple proved this with the iOS and macOS 26 UI[^3] redesigns (liquid glass) that nobody asked for.

To this day, you still can't group tab-select contacts in iMessage or close all apps at once. The first has been present since {new Date().getFullYear() - 2012} years ago in Android 4, and the latter since {new Date().getFullYear() - 2018} years ago in Android 9.

[^1]: A market where competition is so high that it's saturated.
[^2]: A market where competition hasn't yet started.
[^3]: UI is the acronym for [user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface).
