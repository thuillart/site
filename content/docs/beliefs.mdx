# Beliefs

<p className='text-muted-foreground'>By Armand Thuillart</p>

## Shipping fast beats the best strategy
- Speed is a superpower
- Create a bias toward shipping
- Landings > launches (i.e. product adoption > shipping code)
- Listen, build, ship, tell the customer, then repeat forever

## You have no career ceiling
- Grit > talent
- There’s no substitute for putting in the hours
- Get 1% better every day

## Be ruthlessly truth seeking
- The truth can be painful
- You can just change your mind if wrong
- Have strong opinions, loosely held
- Seek the collective truth, not just [one opinion](https://xyproblem.info/)

## Communication is the job
- [Clear writing](https://paulgraham.com/talk.html) is clear thinking
- Everyone (yes, you) needs to become a better writer
- Leaders step up to provide clarity when absent
- Be the person taking notes, even if it’s just for yourself
- Mismatched expectations lead to sadness

## Education is the best form of developer marketing
- Be authentic and own your failures
- Never use the word "webinar" ever again
- Being helpful compounds

## Leadership means owning outcomes beyond the org chart
- Influence > titles
- Leaders have to do the work themselves and delegate
- You can write your own playbook
- Study what worked for others, then take your own path

## Work can also be your hobby
- This doesn’t mean you can’t have other hobbies
- Passion + boundaries > mythical "work-life balance"
- Your best work comes from following your curiosity

## Demos > memos
- You could have built a prototype during the meeting
- Only ship things you're excited about yourself


## Hiring is what separates good leaders from great
- There are two hiring answers: hell yes or no
- Growth potential > current skill
- Hire people you can learn from
- Hire people you would someday be happy working for
- Favorite interview question: what work are you most proud of?

## Always try to assume good intent
- Lead with empathy
- They might just be having a bad day
- Criticism is good feedback if you listen unemotionally
